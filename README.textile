h1. Textile Helpers

This Rails plugin provides some view helpers that enhance Textile support.

h1. Installation

  script/plugin install git@github.com:zeke/textile_helpers.git

As of Rails 2.3, You may also need to install the RedCloth gem..

  sudo gem install redcloth

..and add this to environment.rb

  config.gem "RedCloth"

h2. Overview and Usage

The @textilize_plus@ helper method works just like Rails' "textilize":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/TextHelper.html#M001716 method, but with a few goodies added. It cleans up MS Word characters; repairs (some) faulty markup, such as heading tags (h1, h2, etc) not having a newline underneath them;  adds an id attribute to headings based on the content of the heading.

  textilize_plus(my_string)

The @table_of_contents_for@ helper method is mean to be paired with textilize_plus. It parses your textilizable string and generate a hierarchical table of countents base on the h1, h2, and h3 headings.

<code>
<pre>
    <div id="main">
      <%= textilize_plus(my_string) %>
    </div>
  
    <div id="sidebar">
      <%= table_of_contents_for(my_string) %>
    </div>
  </pre>
</code>

See lib/textile_helpers.rb for more details.
